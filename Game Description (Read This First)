/* You are Emperor Palpatine. Luke's mind tricks have upset you for the last time because of his ability to make fake furniture 
appear from out of thin air. 
You seek silence and peace on a tiny flat planet (perhaps Earth 2.0 because the Earth is flat).
You hope no one will find you there, so, you bring Darth Cuber as your protection. 
However, he has turned BACK to the light side!!! Dun, dun, dun!!!!!
He now tries to push you off the platform as you try destroy all of Luke's fake furniture with your electric powers
as Darth Cuber tries to push you off to your sudden death.
Who will win?! Emperor Palpatine or Darth Cuber and Luke?


The point of the game is that you spawn in and a cube will come charging at you, trying to push you off. You must try to destroy all the
furniture before the cube successfully pushes you off. If you destroy all the furniture before it pushes you off, then you win!
If it pushes you off, you lose.
Use W,A,S,D on your keyboard to move right, left, forward, and backward. Use the mouse left click button to shoot the furniture.
The cube itself is not killable. You are not able to look around, only straight ahead, which gives more of a challenge!!
When you begin the game, you must first left click before being able to move, once you left click, you can move your character. 

Other than that, please enjoy and have fun playing Space Balls!! Have a great summer!
